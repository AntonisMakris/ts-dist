# dtw-dist
This is a python implementation of distance measure between two time series feature vectors based on multidimensional Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). 

## Notes
The following specifications of the distance measure are implemented.
* Exact and locality constrained
* Dependent and independent warping for multidimensional case

## Dependencies
* Python 3
* Numpy
